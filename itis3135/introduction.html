        <p>Personal Background: I was born in Miami, and grew up in Apex, NC. I have 2 siblings adopted from Ukraine and 2 cats.</p>
        <p>Professional Background: I worked at a movie theater from 2021-2022, then at Lowes Foods for a few months, at a bakery until they closed down, and now I work as a waiter at Carabbas.</p>
        <p>Academic Background:  I graduated from Apex Friendship High School in 2022 and am a 3rd year student at UNCC. I am a computer science major concentrating on cybersecurity.</p>
        <p>Background in this Subject:  I have taken a little bit of Harvards CS50 course during quarantine in 2020, but I have very little experience.</p>
        <p>Primary Computer Platform:  An Acer Nitro 5 laptop running Windows 11.</p>
        <p>Courses I'm Taking and Why:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ITSC-3050 iOS Development: I want to branch out into more programming languages and development software.</li>
                <li>CJUS-1511 Foundations of the Criminal Justice System: This is a class I’m taking as an elective because I am interested in the nuances of the Criminal Justice system.</li>
                <li>ITIS-3246 IT Infrastructure and Security: Important material for my major, I also enjoy learning about internet security!</li>
                <li>ITIS-3135 Web-Based Application Design and Development: A lot of the internships I’m interested in have to do with back-end development so this class will help refine those skills and make me a better candidate in job searches.</li>
                <li>ITIS-4214 Usable Security and Privacy: Essential material for my major and concentration, will use these skills within the workforce.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <p>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember Me by: I really like Red Bull, I am a total caffeine addict. Im drinking one while I write this</p>
        <p>I'd also like to Share:  I was on a VEX Robotics team that qualified for the world championships 4 times and placed 17th worldwide in 2021.</p>
