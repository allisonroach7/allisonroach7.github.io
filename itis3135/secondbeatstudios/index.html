            <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
            <p>Second Beat Studios was born from a passion for music and sustainability. We believe that every instrument has a story to tell, even after its musical life has ended. Our team of artisans carefully transforms these instruments into functional art pieces that preserve their musical heritage while serving new purposes.</p>
            <p>Each creation in our collection is truly one-of-a-kind, just like the instruments they come from. We work with local musicians, schools, and collectors to source materials that would otherwise go to waste, giving them a second beat at life.</p>
