        <section id = "good-website">
            <h3><a href = "https://www.apple.com">Apple</a></h3>
            <p>This website follows the CRAP prinicples because it is aesthetically pleasing and everything is organized and nice to look at. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>C - The colors contrast well and the text is easily readable. The color scheme is consistent and clean, and no colors used really stand out above the rest.</li>
                <li>R - Repetition is used to show off different products and services, and is used properly. The product spaces used for iPhones and other products are consistent and similar, but eye catching and attention grabbing within their own way.</li>
                <li>A - Text and images are aligned properly and it does not feel like there is unused space within the website, but it does not feel cluttered either. Images and text within images is aligned center while paragraph text and the bottom of the website is aligned left</li>
                <li>P - Related prodcuts are grouped together and text and images do not overlap. There is blank space within the website, but it does not feel unutilized or empty.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id = "bad-website">
            <h3><a href = "https://thebiguglywebsite.com">The Big Ugly Website</a></h3>
            <p>This website does NOT follow the CRAP prinicples because well... I mean look it it. This wesbite, much like our crappy website assignment, is purposefully designed to be awful in every way. The pictures do not load properly, the margins are awful, the color scheme is abhorrent, and is an overall eyesore.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C - The colors do not contrast well, while everything is easily readable within the wesbite, there is no cohesive color scheme and the colors often clash with one another and it is not aesthetically pleasing.</li>
                <li>R - Repetition is used within the website, but it is not purposeful or cohesive, it just is a bunch of links leading to things relating to the word "ugly"</li>
                <li>A - Every element is aligned to the left, leaving a big empty space on the right side of the screen. A good third of the wesbite space isn't even utilized and is filled with a cream colored void.</li>
                <li>P - This is the biggest offender within the four principles. Text and images overlap, everything is spaced out horribly, no related things are grouped together, and there's a whole lot of empty unutilized space within the website.</li>
            </ul>
